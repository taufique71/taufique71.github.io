      <description>Got up at 5:40am in the morning. And immediately tried to get some more sleep as I thought I had a little chance to catch up the Josshila group. But getting more sleep had to wait as it was hurting me to miss the ride what was supposed to be my last BDCyclists Josshila Saturday for 2017. After getting out with the bike, found out that there was some rain last night.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while I am riding an MTB but never before I have gone for a proper off-road ride. There were several Josshila-Saturday events to the off-roads of Purbachal and Rupganj. But my mud-phobia prevented me to join those. As it&amp;rsquo;s winter, thought there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much mud at this time of the year. So I took this chance.

The sun was just rising. We found a thick layer of fog just above the ground as soon as we left the congested area of Dhaka and moved to the countyside.</description>
