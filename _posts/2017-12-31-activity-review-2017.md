Today is the last day of 2017.
So it's time to review my activities of 2017.
It's time to review how far I could achieve what I intended to achieve this year.
It was kind of a memorable year for me in terms of my activity.
Probably the most active year for me.
So, I thought I should write a post about my feelings. 
I want to start with a infographic that summarizes my 2017 activities.

After ending last two years with milage of 3913 and 3871 kilometers respectively, this year my goal was to complete milage of at least 6000 kilometers.
Which means on average 500 kilometers per month.
I could reach my goal.
