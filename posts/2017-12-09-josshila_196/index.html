<p>Got up at 5:40am in the morning.
And immediately tried to get some more sleep as I thought I had a little chance to catch up the Josshila group.
But getting more sleep had to wait as it was hurting me to miss the ride what was supposed to be my last BDCyclists Josshila Saturday for 2017.
After getting out with the bike, found out that there was some rain last night.
Usually I don&rsquo;t have any problem to ride in heavy rains.
I even like to ride in rains if I have proper protection to my belongings.
But I have a serious problem to ride through muds.
From first glance it seemed to me that it&rsquo;s gonna be a muddy ride.
But this time mud-phobia couldn&rsquo;t resist me to join this Josshila Saturday.<br />
<br/></p>

<p>When I started it was 6:05am.
I rode directly towards Bosilla bridge, which was supposed to be first re-grouping point.
I texted a fellow rider to wait for me at the bridge and started.
Due to strong head-wind and mud-shower from my wheels, it took more than expected time to reach Bosilla.
I reached at 6:28am but found no one to wait for me there.
When I was planning to return home without extending this mud-ridded ride anymore, I found the group to arrive at 6:35am.
They started 15 minutes later than the scheduled time.<br />
<br/></p>

<p>Even though it was supposed to be an intermediate level ride(in terms of speed and milage), it turned out to be a beginner level due to the weather.
And we decided not to increase the milage anymore after we ensured that it is going to be 50km at least (prior plan was for a 65+km ride).
We went upto Rohitpur Bridge and returned.
When coming back we took a detour through Sohana Hotel at Keraniganj to have breakfast with their special rice menu.<br />
